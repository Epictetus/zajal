Zajal
=====

A blend of [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) and a clean consistent syntax, Zajal is a staggeringly awesome creative coding tool.

Can I use it?
-------------
Yes and no. The primary concern at this point is getting the interpreter stable and working, and as such Zajal is not packaged for regular use. If you want to give it a shot, though, feel free.

    $ git clone http://github.com/nasser/zajal.git
    $ cd zajal
    $ make
    $ ./bin/zajal examples/ballerina.rb
    
Once more of the interpreter gets nailed down, expect easy to use one click installs.
