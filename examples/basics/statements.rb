# Statements are the elements that make up programs. A statement is usually a
# single line of code, but a semicolon ';' can be used to break up multiple
# statements on a single line. Comments are used for making notes to help people
# better understand programs. A comment begins with the pound symbol '#' and
# continues to the end of the line.

# The size function is a statement that tells the computer 
# how large to make the window.
# Each function statement has zero or more parameters. 
# Parameters are data passed into the function
# and used as values for specifying what the computer will do.
