# Inspired by the Processing examples
# Play around with the code to see how it changes

# comments begin with a '#' character and continue to the end of the line

circle 250, 250, 100 # this part is commented, but the rest of the code runs

# comments are useful with live, as you can easily turn a piece of code on
# and off by toggling the comments

# try commenting and uncommenting the next line and saving to see it update
# in the sketch window. this is a good way to quickly try things out.
